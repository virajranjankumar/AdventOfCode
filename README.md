My Solutions to the Advent of Code challenge

Quickstart

> npm start

## Usage

```
npm start
npm test
```

By default _npm start_ will invoke all the programs I have made to solve the solutions and run them. The solutions are displayed on the console.

## Test

The tests for my solutions are found in the _test_ directory. If any tests fail they will output the problem to the command line. I have eschewed using a testing framework and gone with a simple **assert** library as provided by nodejs. This was simple enough for my usecase.

```
npm test
```
